# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) based on the Ames Housing dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Performed data cleaning and handled missing values.  
- Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding.  
- Applied feature engineering (bathrooms, porch size, house age).  
- Built regression models: Random Forest and XGBoost.  
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE.

## 🧠 Results
- Validation RMSE: **29,001**  
- The model accurately predicts housing prices based on property characteristics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
